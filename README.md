# Neighborhood Map Project

### A single-page application featuring a map of the Bay Area.

Utilizing the Google Maps Javascript API, the map displays a list of Breweries in the Bay Area as well as a list view that is collapsable. In the list view there is a filtering option to narrow down the items in the list.

#### Running the App
Since there is no server being used for this app, using `localhost` is not required. Once this repository has been cloned, simply navigate to the directory using your GUI and open `index.html`. Alternatively, from the command line in the repo's directory run:

#### APIs Utilized
